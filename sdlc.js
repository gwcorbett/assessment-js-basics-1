// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const Planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisofRequirements = "Second step where developers look over what the project entails, and what is needed to succeed in fulfilling the requirements."
const Design = "Developers outline and create the project to fulfill the requirements needed."
const Implementation = "Step where developers take outlined and mapped out project, and create it"
const TestingIntegration = "After project has been created and set, this part is where developers test the code to make sure it works. They fix bugs and test the code to make sure it fulfills the needed requirements. Then they implement it into a useful function."
const Maintain = "After project is finished, developers must maintain the project through updates. New data needs to be implemented, along with keeping current with working fixes."
